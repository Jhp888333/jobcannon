# Job Cannon

> Oh, get a job? Just get a job? Why don't I strap on my job helmet and squeeze down into a job cannon and fire off into job land, where jobs grow on jobbies?!

## So Why Do?

Job Cannon helps the enterprising job seeker to sort, filter and record interest in job postings on Hackernews' monthly `whoishiring` stories e.g: [Ask HN: Who is hiring? (February 2022)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30164271)

As I was looking for a job, I found that as new job postings were arriving, I was having difficulty tracking what I'd seen before, and opening links to bookmark resulted in me losing context pretty quickly.

When run, it will present the user with a backlog of job postings that can be marked as interesting or not-interesting. Answers are stored under `$YOUR_CONFIG_DIR/jobcannon`.

## Future Plans

- Displaying Job Postings in readable manner
- A TUI for easy expression of interest and reviewing
- More clear separation of different `whoishiring` stories
- Keyword searching
- Smart ordering of the backlog by some real smart AI/ML based on your keywords
